# Grammar-Checker
An effort to make a grammar checker using rule-based approach. I am an NLP enthusiast and have done research on AI-powered text proofreaders. You can find the documentation of my research work here: https://docs.google.com/document/d/1e_nczZTnwadzrACvH-z9ykf-0y_7bhzbNdg3AZySd40/edit?usp=sharing 

After doing a considerable research, I have attempted to start with the implementation using the pre-existing libraries like inflect, pyenchant and nltk.

Things I have worked on:
1. Sentence Boundary Detection
2. Part-of-speech Tagging
3. Spell Check
4. Indefinite Article and following word agreement
